      <description>Some users might want to type their components with flow.
To create a flow-typed component, just use Reacli with either the --flow or the -f option:
reacli component ./my-super-component -f  It will generate a structure like this:
. └── my-super-component ├── components | ├── MySuperComponent.jsx | ├── MySuperComponent.css | └── MySuperComponentContainer.jsx └── index.js  Container component Generated component Explanation  First, we set the // @flow annotation to configure the component to be flow-typed We create Props and State types, in which we will type our component props or type.</description>
